# High-Resolution-Processing-System

> Structurally Constrained High-Resolution Processing System

本项目将计划开发一个基于地质结构约束的高分辨率处理软件，开发环境将以C/C++、Qt为主，结构约束的高分辨率处理算法，将在2024年6月左右完成。个人能力有限，如果有地震数据显示的开发经验的开发者，热烈欢迎您的加入。

This project aims to develop a geologically structured constrained high-resolution processing software. The development environment will mainly utilize C/C++ and Qt. The structurally constrained high-resolution processing algorithm is expected to be completed around June 2024. Due to limited personal capabilities, developers with experience in seismic data visualization are warmly welcomed to join us.
